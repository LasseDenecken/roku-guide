# Performance
Rokus are great devices, but when they are available at $30-$100 US dollars, they are not running $4,000 128core Threadripper CPUs enlisting additional processing help from 10,000 CUDA core GPU’s.  These are $.50¢ CPU’s with limited processing power and memory bandwidth.  Creating systems to make BrightScript more like what you are used to, Angular, MVVM, or whatever, works and is a common approach, but when operations start getting nested in a dozen levels of hierarchy or indirection, the box has a noticeable performance hit, it just doesn’t have the beefiness we are used to and use on PC’s or gaming consoles.

Reading and writing to and from the registry is quick enough, but the required flush after writes is not.  Creating a permanent singleton task to handle flushes, and even writes if wanted, moves that out of the render thread, and can make a significant different in performance if you are using the registry heavily, as I do as for persistent event count accumulators.
